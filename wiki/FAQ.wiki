== General Usage ==

=== Does Review Board support post-commit review? ===

Yes, Review Board can handle post-commit review, though currently you need to [Using_PostReview use post-review] for this.

Review Board was initially designed for pre-commit reviews and large changes need to be made before post-commit reviews can be handled in the web UI. We plan to get to this after Review Board 1.0.


=== What's pre-commit and post-commit reviews? ===

Pre-commit reviews are where code is reviewed before it's checked into a public repository and mainline, non-developer branch. Code isn't committed until reviewers sign off on it, leaving the tree stable and easing changes.

Post-commit reviews are where code is first committed to a public repository and then reviewed. This makes the code available to others to develop against until the code is reviewed, but large-scale changes to the architecture of the code can then be hard to make without disrupting others. Post-commit reviews sometimes happen by individuals or by a large group sitting together and reading over the code together.


== Troubleshooting ==

=== I'm getting a 404 for every page ===

This points to a configuration error in your web server configuration.

If you're using lighttpd as your web server, add the following to settings_local.py file:

{{{
FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = "/"
}}}

If this is a subdirectory install on lighttpd, set this variable to the subdirectory name (making sure to keep leading and trailing slashes).
