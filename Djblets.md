# Djblets #

Djblets is a separate but closely linked project containing a number of useful utility functions and classes for use with [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/). We make it a goal to put generic code written for Review Board into Djblets for other developers to use.

Djblets is under the MIT license.


## Installation ##

Installing Djblets is easy. If you have Python setuptools installed, simply type:

```
$ sudo easy_install --upgrade Djblets
```

This will fetch the latest version and install it.

To fetch the latest bleeding edge release, you can run:

```
$ sudo easy_install --upgrade -f http://www.review-board.org/downloads/bleeding/ Djblets
```


## Development ##

Djblets is hosted in a Git repository. You can [browse](http://github.com/djblets/djblets) the repository or check it out:

## Documentation ##

While Djblets is documented, there is not yet an online version of this documentation.

See the [Django Development with Djblets](http://www.chipx86.com/blog/?p=244) articles and tutorials to get a feel for what's available in Djblets and how to use it.
