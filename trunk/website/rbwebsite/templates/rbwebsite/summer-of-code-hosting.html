<p>
 Review Board has decided to help with the Summer of Code process by providing
 free hosting for Summer of Code-related review requests. We're offering to add
 up to 30 projects to
 <a href="http://gsoc.review-board.org/">gsoc.review-board.org</a> in order to
 aid students and mentors in code review and submission. As we get a feel for
 the load, we may open this up for more projects later.
</p>
<p>
 This is intended for Summer of Code-related submissions only. While we would
 love to provide free hosting to whole projects in general, we can't yet afford
 to do so. It's our hope that Review Board will prove useful to your project,
 encouraging your project to set up a dedicated server for future submissions.
</p>

<h2>What You'll Get</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Free hosting for all Summer of Code-related submissions for your
     project.</li>
 <li>A powerful yet easy to use diff viewer that allows inline commenting,
     making reviewing code a piece of cake.</li>
 <li>Interdiffs, making it easy to review large changes that have undergone
     many revisions.</li>
 <li>Status reports, listing the student's activity over a period of time.</li>
 <li>A complete history of all of your students' changes. Every revision of
     every diff.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applying for Free Hosting</h2>
<p>
 To join, simply send an e-mail to
 <a href="mailto:gsoc-request@review-board.org">gsoc-request@review-board.org</a>
 with the following information:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Project name</li>
 <li>Website</li>
 <li>Short description of the project</li>
 <li>Source code repository information
  <ul>
   <li>Type (SVN, CVS...)</li>
   <li>Repository path</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Mailing list for review request and review e-mails (optional).</li>
 <li>Bug tracker URL</li>
 <li>Number of students you're expecting</li>
 <li>A link to the Summer of Code listings for any students or mentors
     involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 We'll respond to your request usually within the day and get things set up.
</p>
<p>
 There's a
 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/reviewboard-gsoc">reviewboard-gsoc
 mailing list</a> for discussion and announcements in all-things
 Review Board Summer of Code. This will be the primary mailing list for
 students participating in Summer of Code for Review Board, but we expect
 it to be fairly low-traffic.
</p>

<h2>What's the Catch?</h2>
<p>
 There's no catch. We're doing this with the hope of spreading Review Board in
 the open source community and making it a better product. We hope your project
 finds Review Board useful and will decide to set up a dedicated installation
 down the road.
</p>
<p>
 Code review is something most open source projects do at some level, but there
 aren't many good tools out there to help. We believe making code review easier
 and more fun through Review Board can lead to better applications.
</p>

<h2>Getting Students Ready</h2>
<p>
 Students and mentors wanting to use Review Board should download
 <a href="http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/source/browse/trunk/reviewboard/contrib/tools/post-review">post-review</a>,
 put it somewhere in their path and make it executable. To configure it with
 the Summer of Code Review Board server, put the following in
 <tt>$HOME/.reviewboardrc</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
REVIEWBOARD_URL = "http://gsoc.review-board.org/"
</pre>
<p>
 You'll want to read the
 <a href="{% url doc-page "manual" "dev" "users/tools/post-review" %}">post-review documentation</a>.
 There's additional general
 <a href="{% url doc-index %}">documentation</a> available as well.
</p>

<h2>Reporting Problems</h2>
<p>
 While things should generally run smoothly, it is possible that there will be
 issues. If you do have a problem with the servers or anything related to
 Summer of Code and Review Board, you can post to the
 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/reviewboard-gsoc">reviewboard-gsoc
 mailing list</a>.
</p>
<p>
 If you have general Review Board questions, would like help setting up your
 own installation, or want to contribute back to the project, you can join the
 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/reviewboard">Review Board mailing
 list</a> and post there.
