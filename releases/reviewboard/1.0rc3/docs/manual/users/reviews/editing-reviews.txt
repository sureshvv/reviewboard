Editing and Publishing Reviews
==============================

After you have commented on any parts of a review request (specifically a diff
or a screenshot), a green review draft banner will appear docked to the top
of any page related to that review request. This banner gives you the ability
to edit, publish, or discard the review request.

Clicking the :guilabel:`Review` button on the review request action bar, or
clicking :guilabel:`Edit Review` on the review draft banner will pop open a
form for seeing and modifying your current review.

Here you can add some text above or below the comments or modify the text of
existing comments. When done, you can either publish the review (along with
any changes made), or you can just save the changes by clicking
:guilabel:`Save`.

To publish the review, click :guilabel:`Publish Review` on the review form or
:guilabel:`Publish` on the review banner.

Likewise, you can discard the review, deleting all comments permanently, by
clicking the :guilabel:`Discard Review` button on the review form or
:guilabel:`Discard` on the review banner.

Published reviews will appear on the review request page, where they can be
read and commented on.
