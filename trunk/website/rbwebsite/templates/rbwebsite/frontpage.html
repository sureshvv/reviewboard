 For too long, code reviews have been too much of a chore. This is largely due
 to the lack of quality tools available, leaving developers to resort to e-mail
 and bug tracker-based solutions.

 We've seen a lot of time and energy wasted doing code reviews both in open
 source projects and at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>. In both
 cases, code reviews were typically done over e-mail. A significant amount of
 time was spent in forming review requests, switching between the diff and the
 e-mail, and trying to understand what parts of the code the reviewer was
 referring to.

 In an effort to keep our sanity and improve the process both in our
 open source projects and at companies, we wrote Review Board.

 Review Board is a powerful web-based code review tool that offers developers
 an easy way to handle code reviews. It scales well from small projects to
 large companies and offers a variety of tools to take much of the stress and
 time out of the code review process.
