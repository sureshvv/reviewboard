.. _`Send e-mails`:

* **Send e-mails for review requests and reviews:**
    If enabled, e-mails will be sent out whenever a review request is
    posted or updated, or when reviews and replies are posted.

    See `E-Mail and Review Groups`_ for more information.

* **Mail Server:**
    The SMTP mail server used for outgoing e-mails.
    This defaults to ``localhost``.

* **Port:**
    The SMTP mail server port. This defaults to ``25``.

* **Username:**
    The username needed to connect to the outgoing SMTP mail server, if any.
    This is optional and depends on the mail server configuration.

* **Password:**
    The password needed to connect to the outgoing SMTP mail server, if any.
    This is optional and depends on the mail server configuration.

* **Use TLS for authentication:**
    If enabled, TLS is used for mail server authentication. This is more
    secure, but requires TLS support on the mail server.
