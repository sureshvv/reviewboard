Review Board sites can be configured through the Settings portion of the
:ref:`Administration UI`. You'll generally need to make some changes in here
before others use the site.

Clicking on :guilabel:`Settings` anywhere in the :ref:`Administration UI` will
take you to the :ref:`general-settings` page. The navigation bar below the
main administration navigation bar contains links for jumping to the other
available settings pages, which consists of:
