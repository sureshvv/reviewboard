General Settings
================

The General Settings page contains most of the settings you'll want to change
for a new site. It's split up into the following sections:

* :ref:`site-settings`
* :ref:`search-settings`
* :ref:`advanced-authentication`
* :ref:`ldap-authentication-settings`
* :ref:`custom-authentication-settings`


.. _site-settings:

Site Settings
=============

In this section you'll specify the paths, administrator contacts and basic
authentication settings for the site.

The following settings can be configured:

* **Server:**
    The URL of the site. This should include the ``http://`` or
    ``https://`` but should not contain the subdirectory Review Board
    is set up to use.

    This setting is required.

* **Media URL:**
    The URL to the media files. This can point to a dedicated
    server, or it can be a path relative to installed Review Board
    site.

    This setting is optional, and if left blank, the default
    media path of ``/media/`` is used.

* **Administrator Name:**
    The full name of the primary administrator for this Review Board site.

    This setting is required.

* **Administrator E-Mail:**
    The e-mail address of the primary administrator for this Review Board
    site.

    This setting is required.

* **Allow anonymous read-only access:**
    Determines whether or not anonymous users should be able to view
    posted review requests and diffs.

    This is often safe to enable when the code being posted is public or when
    there's strict access controls to the site itself. If the code is
    confidential and it's possible for people without authority to access
    the server, this should be disabled.


.. _search-settings:

Search
======

* **Enable search:**
    If enabled, a search field is provided at the top of every page to
    quickly search through review requests.

    This feature depends on a working :ref:`installing-pylucene` and
    regular :ref:`search-indexing` to work.


.. _search-index-directory:

* **Search index directory:**
    The directory on the server's file system where the search index files
    will be stored. This defaults to a directory named "search-index" in the
    site's directory, if left blank.

    Either absolute or relative paths can be provided. A relative path will
    always be relative to the site directory.

    This option is only available if search is enabled.


.. _advanced-authentication:

Advanced Authentication
=======================

.. _`Authentication Method`:
.. _authentication-method:

* **Authentication Method:**
    The method used for authenticating users on this Review Board server.

    Review Board has multiple ways of authenticating users. By default,
    "Standard registration" is used, but other methods can be selected. See
    :ref:`Authentication` for more information.

    Depending on the authentication method selected, additional settings may
    be available.

    Available options are:

    * Standard registration
    * LDAP
    * NIS
    * Custom


.. _ldap-authentication-settings:

LDAP Authentication Settings
============================

This is available if `Authentication Method`_ is set to "LDAP".

* **LDAP Server:**
    The LDAP server to authenticate with.
    For example: ``ldap://localhost:389``

    This setting is required.

* **LDAP Base DN:**
    The LDAP Base DN for performing LDAP searches.
    For example: ``ou=users,dc=example,dc=com``

    This setting is required.

* **E-Mail Domain:**
    The domain name appended to the user's login name to form the e-mail
    address. For example: ``example.com``

    This setting is required.

* **Use TLS for authentication:**
    If checked, then TLS will be used for all authentication requests. This
    option is more secure, but must be enabled on the LDAP server.

* **User Mask:**
    The string representing the user. The string must contain the text
    ``%s`` where the username would normally go.
    For example: ``(uid=%s)``

    This setting is required.

* **Anonymous User Mask:**
    The user mask string for anonymous users. This should be in the same
    format as User Mask.

    This setting is optional. If not provided, anonymous logins will be
    disabled.

* **Anonymous User Password:**
    The password for the anonymous user.

    This setting is optional.


.. _nis-authentication-settings:

NIS Authentication Settings
===========================

This is available if `Authentication Method`_ is set to "NIS".

* **E-Mail Domain:**
    The domain name appended to the user's login name to form the e-mail
    address. For example: ``example.com``

    This setting is required.


.. _custom-authentication-settings:

Custom Authentication Settings
==============================

This is available if `Authentication Method`_ is set to "Custom".

* **Backends:**
    A comma-separated list of custom Django authentication backend classes.
    These are represented as Python module paths.

    This is an advanced setting and should only be used if you know what
    you're doing.

    This setting is required.
