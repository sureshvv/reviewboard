===================
Database Management
===================

The Database section of the `Administration UI`_ allows you to view and modify
the actual contents of the Review Board database in a simple, human-readable
fashion.

With the exception of the `management tables`_, most tables are used for
`data storage`_ only and should not be modified unless you know what you're
doing.

.. warning:: If not handled carefully, modifying entries in the database
             can lead to data loss or corruption.


Management Tables
=================

The management tables are the areas of the database you're most likely to
modify in your installation.

.. _data storage:

Data Storage Tables
===================

As the name suggests, data storage tables contain data for such things as
review requests, raw site settings, diffs, and so on. These should usually be
left untouched, but there may be occasions when you'll need to fix something
for another user by modifying one of these tables.

The table below is grouped by the sections listed in the Database page in the
`Administration UI`_.
