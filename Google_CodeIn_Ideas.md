# Introduction #

Tasks come in 8 flavors:

  1. Code: Tasks related to writing or refactoring code
  1. Documentation: Tasks related to creating/editing documents
  1. Outreach: Tasks related to community management and outreach/marketing
  1. Quality Assurance: Tasks related to testing and ensuring code is of high quality
  1. Research: Tasks related to studying a problem and recommending solutions
  1. Training: Tasks related to helping others learn more
  1. Translation: Tasks related to localization
  1. User Interface: Tasks related to user experience research or user interface design and interaction


Note that many "Documentation" and "Outreach" tasks also can qualify as "Training", and many of the "Code" tasks are also related to "User Interface".
