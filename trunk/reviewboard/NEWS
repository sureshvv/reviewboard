version 1.0 alpha 4 (16-February-2009):
	* Bugs Fixed in post-review:
		* post-review should now work with SVN regardless of the locale set.
		  (Bug #888)

	* Bugs fixed in Review Board:
		* Fixed an infinite loop in the Git diff parser. Patch by Dennis Schön.
		  (Bug #887)

		* The first file in the diff viewer would sometimes come back as
		  escaped HTML. It's now embedded correctly.

		* The comment dialog's "dirty" state wasn't being reset for new
		  comments. This would leave reviewers unable to make new comments.



version 1.0 alpha 3 (15-February-2009):
	* Bugs Fixed in rb-site:
		* Generated settings_local.py files no longer have DEBUG=True enabled
		  by default.

		* The generated FastCGI and Apache config files should now work better
		  out of the box. We had path issues in reviewboard.fcgi. We also
		  now set the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE directory and default to processing
		  .htaccess files in htdocs (which some distros don't have enabled
		  by default).


	* Bugs Fixed in the Diff Viewer:
		* Fixed some major performance issues when typing in the diff viewer.
		  This was the cause of many reports of slowdown and visual oddities
		  when creating comments.

		* Unchanged files should no longer show errors in interdiffs.

		* Fixed file-based navigation ("<" and ">" keys) in the diff viewer.
		  (Bug #696)

		* We no longer show a nonsensical error when SVN logins fail.
		  (Bug #721)

		* Fixed anchors in the diff viewer. (Bug #828)

		* Fixed the "Expand/Collapse Diffs" toggle in the diff viewer.
		  (Bug #862)


	* Bugs Fixed in Reviews:
		* The review request page is no longer cached across login sessions.
		  We were over-aggressive in the caching and are now a lot more
		  careful.

		* Upload Diff/Screenshot dialogs on Safari are now centered instead
		  of being docked to the far-left side.

		* Uploading diffs and screenshots now works on Safari.

		* Empty Changeset errors in Perforce should now properly be shown
		  to the user. They were in some cases triggering a server-side
		  error.

		* The Change Description field no longer animates open on page load.

		* Sentences containing the word "bug" or "issue" no longer generate
		  links unless followed by either specifically a number or a "#"
		  followed by alphanumeric characters.

		* Fixed some escaping issues in the review request summary, which
		  would cause characters (such as quotes) to appear incorrectly.
		  (Bug #860)

		* Fixed some issues with auto-linking text in the Description and
		  Testing Done fields. There were issues on initial page loads with
		  linking URLs that were followed by quotes, "<" and ">". (Bug #864)


	* Feature Improvements:
		* We now pre-load the first file on a page in the diff viewer, in
		  order to make it appear that the page is loading faster. Many people
		  felt the new, faster diff viewer was slower because even after the
		  initial page load, they had to wait to see any diffs. They're now
		  able to work with the first diff the moment the diff viewer loads.

		* Added hover/clicked styling for the review request action buttons.



version 1.0 alpha 2 (3-February-2009):
	* Bugs Fixed in post-review:
		* We now strip the filename coming in from Perforce.
		  There can be a trailing newline sometimes, resulting in a failed
		  upload. (Bug #726)

		* We set the correct locale now when invoking svn. Patch by
		  Łukasz Jernaś. (Bug #822)

		* Fixed backwards version comparison logic in post-review's GitClient.
		  Patch by Stacey Sheldon.

		* Added support for hgsubversion. Patch by Augie Fackler

		* Added support for Clearcase. Patch by Daniel Belz.


	* Bugs Fixed in rb-site:
		* rb-site now sets "postgresql_psycopg2" as the DATABASE_ENGINE
		  for PostgreSQL installs. Patch by Rusty Burchfield. (Bug #749)

		* rb-site should now generate config files that work correctly on
		  Windows servers.


	* Bugs Fixed in Review Board:
		* Whitespace from usernames are now stripped on LDAP accounts,
		  which prevents duplicate user accounts in the database. (Bug #728)

		* Fixed a bug where anchors in comment flags were incorrect and were
		  getting lost when setting the comment count for the flag. This
		  was breaking anchors to parts of the diff. (Bug #820)

		* The fields in the comment dialog are now disabled if the user is
		  not logged in. (Bug #827)

		* Key presses in dialogs or in the review request details box no longer
		  trigger navigation in the diff viewer. (Bug #828)

		* The "Review" link on a review request is no longer displayed if
		  the user is not logged in.

		* Trailing whitespace wasn't shown in diff fragments on the
		  review request page.

		* Trailing whitespace wasn't always shown in the diff viewer, if
		  it appeared in the middle of a comment block.

		* Removed some old YUI files that were still in the repository.


	* Feature Improvements:
		* Improved lighttpd and Apache+fastcgi support. A Review Board
		  install using either lighttpd or Apache+fastcgi should now work
		  out of the box without setting up any custom scripts for launching
		  fastcgi.

		* The diff fragments placeholders in the review request page are now
		  set to the same size as the fragment itself. This means that
		  progressively loaded fragments should no longer cause the page
		  to jump nearly as much, resulting in a smoother loading experience.

		* When displaying the Review form, we now make sure that the form
		  is scrolled to the top. This fixes a bug where the page was often
		  scrolled to the bottom of the list of comments.

		* Several improvements were made to Bazaar support. We now use
		  bzrlib and support revid information in the diff header.

		* The comment dialog is now slightly wider and has slightly smaller
		  text, resulting in more room for comments.


	* New Features:
		* Load times for nearly all parts of Review Board have greatly
		  increased. The browser is now instructed to aggressively cache
		  media files and many pages, meaning fewer downloads when going to
		  any particular page.

		  We optimize the order in which resources are loaded in order to
		  take advantage of the browser's ability to parallelize downloads
		  of similar resources types (such as CSS files or JavaScript).

		  The results of these files are GZip'd to further increase transfer
		  speeds.

		  Apache users will get these improvements for free. lighttpd users
		  will need to upgrade their lighttpd config file based on the
		  template provided with Review Board in the contrib/conf/
		  directory.

		  On top of this, we now use jQuery 1.3.1, which is many times faster
		  than the previous version of jQuery we were using, and we also
		  have a number of improvements such as progressive loading of the
		  diff viewer.

		* Added progressive loading of the diff viewer. This is one of the
		  main features of this release. Regardless of the size of the diff,
		  the diff viewer now loads quickly, and loads each file's diff
		  progressively. This gives people the ability to review code before
		  all the diffs have even been generated.

		  This also fixes some major scalability issues we've had with large
		  diffs. In theory, it's now possible to review very large diffs
		  that span many pages.

		* Added support for linkifying pieces of text in the Description and
		  Testing Done fields. (Issue #258)

		  The following formats are supported:
		  * URLs
		  * /r/123 numbers (even /r/123/diff and such)
		  * bug/issue numbers (in the form of "bug abc123", "bug #abc123",
		    "issue abc123" and "issue #abc123")

		* Added support for Clearcase repositories. This depends on a mounted
		  view on the Review Board server. Patch by Daniel Belz.
