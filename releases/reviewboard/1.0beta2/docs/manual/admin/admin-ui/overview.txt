Overview of the Administration UI
=================================

The Administration UI provides configuration options, database management,
news updates and system information. This area is available to all users with
`administrator`_ access and can be reached by clicking "Admin" in the
top-right of any Review Board page.

The Administration UI is composed of three main areas:

* `Dashboard`_
* `Database Management`_
* `Settings`_

These can be reached through the navigation bar at the top of any page.
