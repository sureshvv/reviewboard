#summary Information on setting up buildbot slaves

= Setting up Buildbot Slaves =

Setting up a buildbot slave is pretty easy. There's only a few things that need to be installed.

Right now we only support buildbot on Linux systems, but in the future we'll work toward Windows as well. This document also assumes Debian or Ubuntu in some places.


== Dependencies ==

First, you'll need svn and setuptools. This is best installed through your distribution's native package:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install subversion python-setuptools
}}}

You'll then need to get virtualenv on your system:

{{{
$ sudo easy_install virtualenv
}}}

The buildbot steps will install PIL (Python Imaging Library), which will have to compile a few things. You'll need gcc and the Python development headers for this. On Debian/Ubuntu, this is easily done:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging
}}}


== Creating the Slave ==

Slaves generally live in {{{/var/lib/buildbot}}} somewhere. To keep it organized, I recommend something like {{{/var/lib/buildbot/slaves/reviewboard}}}. Assuming this setup, do the following:

{{{
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/buildbot/slaves/reviewboard
$ sudo buildbot create-slave /var/lib/buildbot/slaves/reviewboard build.review-board.org:9989 _slavename_ _password_
}}}


The slave name and password are pretty much up to you. I recommend including the distro name and version, and the Python version. We'll need both the name and password to finish setup on our end.


Once this is complete, go into the new slave directory and type:

{{{
$ ln -s /usr/bin/virtualenv virtualenv
}}}


This should be all that's needed!
