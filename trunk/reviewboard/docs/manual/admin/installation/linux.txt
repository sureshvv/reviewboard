===================
Installing on Linux
===================


Before You Begin
================

Review Board is provided as downloadable packages through
`Python setuptools`_. The easy part is installing Review Board itself. The
harder part is installing some of the dependencies, which we have less control
over. This guide will help with some of these dependencies.

It's assumed that you know which database and web server you want to use,
and have already installed these on your server. It's also assumed that
you have Python v2.4 or v2.5 installed.

Review Board supports the following database servers:

* MySQL_ v5.0.31 or newer
* PostgreSQL_
* sqlite_ v3

And the following web servers:

* Apache_ + mod_python or fastcgi
* lighttpd_ + fastcgi


If you're running Fedora_, you may need to add the `Fedora Extras`_ repository
to your yum configuration.

The instructions below are assuming you're logged in as ``root`` or
are using :command:`sudo`.


.. _MySQL: http://www.mysql.com/
.. _PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org/
.. _sqlite: http://www.sqlite.org/
.. _Apache: http://www.apache.org/
.. _lighttpd: http://www.lighttpd.net/

.. _`Fedora Extras`: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Extras


Installing Python Setuptools
============================

Before you begin, you'll need `Python setuptools`_. Most Linux distributions
have this packaged and available for installation.

To install on on Debian_, Ubuntu_, or another Debian-based distribution,
type::

    $ apt-get install python-setuptools


To install on a `RedHat Enterprise`_, Fedora_, CentOS_, or another
RedHat-based distribution, type::

    $ yum install python-setuptools


Users of other distributions should check with their distribution for native
packages, or follow the `setuptools installation`_ instructions.

.. index:: memcached

Installing memcached
====================

Memcached_ is a high-performant caching server used by Review Board. While
optional, it's **strongly** recommended in order to have a fast, responsive
setup. Along with memcached, we need the cmemcache_ Python bindings.

To install on Debian_ or Ubuntu_, type::

    $ apt-get install memcached libmemcache-dev

To install on `RedHat Enterprise`_, Fedora_ or CentOS_, type::

    $ yum install memcached

If libmemcache_ is not available in your distribution, you'll need to compile
it manually or download an RPM from http://tangent.org/552/libmemcached.html.

Next you'll need to install cmemcache_. This may be provided by your
distribution. If not, you can install it from http://gijsbert.org/cmemcache/.
Download the tarball and do the following::

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
    $ make
    $ make install


.. _memcached: http://www.danga.com/memcached/
.. _libmemcache: http://tangent.org/552/libmemcached.html
.. _cmemcache: http://gijsbert.org/cmemcache/


Installing patch
================

:command:`patch` is required for Review Board's diff viewer to work.
All distributions should provide this.

To install on Debian_ or Ubuntu_, type::

    $ apt-get install patch

To install on `RedHat Enterprise`_, Fedora_ or CentOS_, type::

    $ yum install patch


Installing Review Board
=======================

To install Review Board and its required dependencies (Djblets,
`Django-Evolution`_, Django_, flup_, and `Python Imaging Library`_) in one go,
type::

    $ easy_install ReviewBoard


This will automatically download and install the latest stable release of
Review Board and the required versions of its core dependencies.


Installing Database Bindings
============================

Depending on the database you plan to use, you will probably need additional
bindings.


MySQL
-----

To install, type::

    $ easy_install mysql-python


Distributions may provide native packages.

To install on Debian_ or Ubuntu_, type::

    $ apt-get install python-mysqldb


PostgreSQL
----------

To install, type::

    $ easy_install psycopg2


SQLite
------

.. note:: If you have Python 2.5 or higher, you already have SQLite and won't
          need to install this.

To install, type::

    $ easy_install pysqlite

Distributions may provide native packages.

To install on Debian_ or Ubuntu_, type::

    $ apt-get install python-sqlite2

To install on Fedora_ type::

    $ yum install py-pysqlite2


Additional instructions for other distributions `are available
<http://oss.itsystementwicklung.de/trac/pysqlite/wiki/PysqlitePackages>`_


Installing Source Control Components
====================================

Depending on which source control systems you plan to use, you will need
some additional components.


CVS
---

To use Review Board with CVS_, you'll need the :command:`cvs` package
installed. This is available on almost every distribution.

To install on Debian_ or Ubuntu_, type::

    $ apt-get install cvs

To install on `RedHat Enterprise`_, Fedora_ or CentOS_, type::

    $ yum install cvs


.. _CVS: http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/


Git
---

To install on Debian_ or Ubuntu_, type::

    $ apt-get install git-core

To install on Fedora_, type::

    $ yum install git-core

If your distribution doesn't provide Git_, you'll need to install it
manually from http://www.git-scm.com/.


.. _Git: http://www.git-scm.com/


Mercurial
---------

To install support for Mercurial_, type::

    $ easy_install mercurial

You can also check your distribution for a native package, or use one of the
`binary packages
<http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryPackages>`_ provided.


.. _Mercurial: http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/


Perforce
--------

To use Review Board with Perforce_, you'll first need to install
:command:`p4` some place in your web server's path (usually :file:`/usr/bin`).
You'll then need to install the Python bindings by typing the following::

    $ easy_install P4PythonInstaller

This should fetch the appropriate versions of the ``p4api`` library and
compile it. This will require that you have standard build tools
(:command:`gcc`, :command:`make`, etc.) installed on your system.


.. _Perforce: http://www.perforce.com/


Subversion
----------

To use Review Board with Subversion_, you'll need both subversion and
PySVN_ installed.

To install on Debian_ or Ubuntu_, type::

    $ apt-get install subversion python-svn

To install on Fedora_, type::

    $ yum install subversion pysvn

`RedHat Enterprise`_ and CentOS_ provide subversion, but you may have to
install PySVN from scratch. To install Subversion, type::

    $ yum install subversion

If your distribution doesn't provide PySVN, you can install it by
`downloading <http://pysvn.tigris.org/project_downloads.html>`_ the latest
release and following the instructions in the provided :file:`INSTALL.html`.


.. _Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/
.. _PySVN: http://pysvn.tigris.org/


.. _installing-pylucene:

Installing PyLucene
===================

This is an optional step.

We use PyLucene_ for our search functionality. It can be complicated to
install, and requires a working Java installation.


Ubuntu Jaunty and Debian Testing
--------------------------------

If you're using Ubuntu_ Jaunty or Debian_ Testing, you can simply install this
by typing::

    $ sudo apt-get install pylucene

Otherwise, you'll have to perform a manual installation.


Manual Installation
-------------------

You'll need the following dependencies to build PyLucene:

* gcc/g++
* Sun's JDK
* Ant_
* Python development packages

On Debian_ and Ubuntu_, you can install these by typing::

    $ sudo apt-get install gcc g++ sun-java6-jdk ant python-dev

Once these are installed, you'll need to download the `latest version
<http://downloads.osafoundation.org/PyLucene/jcc/>`_ of PyLucene and extract
the tarball.

.. _Ant: http://ant.apache.org/
.. _PyLucene: http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/


Compile JCC
~~~~~~~~~~~

JCC is needed to compile PyLucene, and is bundled along with PyLucene.

First, change to the directory containing the extracted PyLucene files, and
then type, as root::

    $ cd jcc
    $ python setup.py install


Compile PyLucene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once JCC is installed, you can compile PyLucene. Change back to the
PyLucene directory and type, as root::

    $ make
    $ make install


Cleaning Up
~~~~~~~~~~~

Optionally, you can now remove your JDK and install a JRE in order to save
space. This won't make any difference to the PyLucene installation either way.

You can also remove your PyLucene tarball and the source directory.


Installing Development Tools
============================

If you plan to work on Review Board's source code, there are a few
additional packages you'll need to install:

* nose_
* Sphinx_

You can install these in one go by typing::

    $ easy_install nose Sphinx


.. _nose: http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/


.. _`Django-Evolution`: http://django-evolution.googlecode.com/
.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/
.. _flup: http://www.saddi.com/software/flup
.. _`Python Imaging Library`: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/


.. _Debian: http://www.debian.org/
.. _Ubuntu: http://www.ubuntu.com/
.. _`RedHat Enterprise`: http://www.redhat.com/
.. _Fedora: http://www.fedoraproject.org/
.. _CentOS: http://www.centos.org/


After Installation
==================

Once you've finished getting Review Board itself installed, you'll want to
create your site. See :ref:`Creating Sites` for details.
