convenient shortcuts for common management tasks, some server information, and
Review Board project news updates.

Manage

The "Manage" section provides shortcuts to some common management tasks.
These are specifically links to add and edit the following entries in the
database:

* Users
* Review groups
* Default reviewers
* Repositories

clicking "Users" will show the list of all users. This is the same page that
you would get by clicking the same name in the `Database Management`_ section.

Clicking the "Add" link beside the name will let you quickly add a new item in
that section.

The number in parenthesis beside the name is the number of existing entries.
