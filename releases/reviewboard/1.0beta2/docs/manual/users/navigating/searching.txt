Overview
========

Depending on your Review Board server setup, you may have the ability to
search through review requests. If enabled, you should see a search bar on the
right of the navigation banner.

The search functionality allows you to search for text matching part of the
review request, files modified, and other information.


Query Syntax
============

There are a variety of ways to combine terms in the search field. By default,
the search results will be an "OR" of any words entered in the box. This means
searching for ``window javascript`` will give pages that have either of those
words in them.

In order to narrow down your results, there are a few useful operators you can
use.

* **AND**:

  This operator will change the relationship from "OR" to "AND". This will
  make it so search results will contain all of the words instead of any.
  Searching for ``window AND javascript`` will yield only review requests that
  contain both of those words.

* **NOT**:

  This works a lot like ``AND``, except it will filter out results containing
  the NOT term. For example, ``window NOT javascript`` will return matches
  that have "window" but not "javascript".

* **Phrase**:

  Sticking something in double-quotes will search for the exact phrase instead
  of splitting it up into terms.

There are a number of other operators you can use to tweak the results. For a
full explanation of the Lucene query syntax (including a couple features not
mentioned here), see `Lucene Query Parser Syntax`_.

Fields
======

In addition to searching the full text of a review request, you can search
individual fields for better results. To search for a term inside a specific
field, prefix that term with *field*:, where *field* is one of the below:

* ``summary``:

  This field searches only the summary. ``summary: window`` will match
  requests with window in the summary only.

* ``author`` and ``username``:

  These two fields search the review request poster. ``author`` will search
  both the username and full name, whereas ``username`` is just the username.

* ``bug``:

  This field searches by bug identifier. Searching for ``bug:83724`` will find
  any review requests which address that bug.

* ``file``:

  This field indexes filenames in the diff. Searching for ``file:frob.c`` will
  yield any review requests which altered that file.

These fields can be combined like any other terms. Searches like
``file:frob.c AND author:Jim`` can make it easy to quickly find old review
requests.


What Gets Indexed
=================

At the moment, this indexes the full text of review requests, and file lists
in diffs. The reviews added by others are not yet part of this, but should be
coming soon.
