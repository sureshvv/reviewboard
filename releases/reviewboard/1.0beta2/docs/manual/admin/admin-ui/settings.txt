Review Board sites can be configured through the Settings portion of the
`Administration UI`_. You'll generally need to make some changes in here
before others use the site.

Clicking on `Settings` anywhere in the `Administration UI`_ will take you
to the `General Settings`_ page. The navigation bar below the main
administration navigation bar contains links for jumping to the other
available settings pages, which consists of:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   general-settings
   email-settings
   diffviewer-settings
   logging-settings


.. _`Administration UI`: ../overview
.. _`General Settings`: ../general-settings
