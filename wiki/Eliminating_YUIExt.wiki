= Introduction =

When Review Board was first written, we chose to use [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ YUI] and YUI-Ext as our JavaScript toolkits. Since then, YUI-Ext has been replaced with a completely new (and backward-incompatible) implementation called [http://www.extjs.com/ ExtJS].

Some experimental work was done toward moving to ExtJS, but there are licensing concerns. ExtJS is dual-licensed and it's not clear where we fit. It is partially under a commercial license and partially under GPL 3. Their license terms place some additional restrictions and since we are not a GPL 3 application and are instead MIT, which allows people to modify our code and not release it, we're pretty sure there will eventually be licensing issues. Especially if anyone produces an extension down the road on top of Review Board that is intended for sale.

= What are we moving to? =

We have decided to move to [http://www.jquery.com/ jQuery], a popular and powerful JavaScript library.

As of October 27, the work to move over to jQuery is nearly complete. With this comes a simpler and more streamlined UI for Review Board. Once a few more tests have been run and a couple features implemented, this will go up for review.
