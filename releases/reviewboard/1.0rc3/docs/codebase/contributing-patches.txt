====================
Contributing Patches
====================

New patches should always be based on our latest code in SVN.

Patches should be posted on our project's Review Board server at
http://reviews.review-board.org/. We'll review the patches there, and
eventually submit the change if we agree it belongs in the codebase.

We do not accept patches to the `mailing lists`_ or our `bug tracker`_.
If a patch is posted there, we will ask that it be resubmitted to our
Review Board server.

Before submitting patches, please make sure the code adheres to the
:ref:`Coding Standards`.

We also strongly encourage contributors to submit unit tests along with
their code.
