Installing on Windows
=====================

Before You Begin
================

Review Board is provided as downloadable packages through
`Python setuptools`_. The easy part is installing Review Board itself. The
harder part is installing some of the dependencies, which we have less control
over. This guide will help with some of these dependencies.

It's assumed that you know which database and web server you want to use,
and have already installed these on your server.

Review Board supports the following database servers:

* MySQL_ v5.0.31 or newer
* PostgreSQL_
* sqlite_ v3

And the following web servers:

* Apache_ + mod_python or fastcgi
* lighttpd_ + fastcgi

Installing Python Support
=========================

You can install Python by running the latest `Python 2.5 Installer`_ for
Windows.

You'll then need to run the latest `Python Setuptools Installer`_ (look
toward the bottom of the page for the file listing).

Once Python and Setuptools are installed, you'll need to add a couple
directories to your system path.

1. Open :menuselection:`Start --> Control Panel` and navigate to the
   :guilabel:`System` icon.
2. Click on the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab.
3. Click :guilabel:`Environment Variables`.
4. Find :envvar:`PATH` in :guilabel:`System variables` and click
   :guilabel:`Edit`.
5. Add ``;C:\Python25;C:\Python25\Scripts`` (substitute your Python
   directory if it's not ``C:\Python25``) to the end of the list.

.. index:: memcached

Installing memcached
====================

Memcached_ is a high-performant caching server used by Review Board. While
optional, it's **strongly** recommended in order to have a fast, responsive
setup. Along with memcached, we need the `python-memcached`_ Python bindings.

1. Download `memcached for Windows`_.
2. Unzip this to the directory you want to keep memcached in (for example,
   :file:`C:\\memcached`).
3. If running Vista, you'll need to set this to run as an administrator.
   Right-click on :file:`memcached.exe` and click :guilabel:`Properties`.
   Click the :guilabel:`Compatibility` tab and then check
   :guilabel:`Run this program as an administrator`.
4. Install the service from the command line by typing the following from
   the memcached directory::

      memcached.exe -d install

5. Start the server through the Microsoft Management Console.
6. Install `python-memcached`_ by typing the following::

      easy_install python-memcached

.. _`python-memcached`:

After Installation
==================

Once you've finished getting Review Board itself installed, you'll want to
create your site. See :ref:`Creating Sites` for details.
