Review Board is under the MIT license, which basically means you are free to do as you want. You must however keep the software under the MIT license.

This permits companies to create custom modifications of Review Board for their setups without contributing back. However, we strongly encourage people to contribute back to the project, as it benefits everybody and will ease upgrades by helping to keep your codebase from straying too far from ours.


=== Does Review Board support post-commit review? ===

Yes, Review Board can handle post-commit review, though currently you need to [Using_PostReview use post-review] for this.

Review Board was initially designed for pre-commit reviews and large changes need to be made before post-commit reviews can be handled in the web UI. We plan to get to this after Review Board 1.0.


=== What's pre-commit and post-commit reviews? ===

Pre-commit reviews are where code is reviewed before it's checked into a public repository and mainline, non-developer branch. Code isn't committed until reviewers sign off on it, leaving the tree stable and easing changes.

Post-commit reviews are where code is first committed to a public repository and then reviewed. This makes the code available to others to develop against until the code is reviewed, but large-scale changes to the architecture of the code can then be hard to make without disrupting others. Post-commit reviews sometimes happen by individuals or by a large group sitting together and reading over the code together.
