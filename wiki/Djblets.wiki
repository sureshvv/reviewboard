#summary Information on the Djblets module

= Djblets =

Djblets is a separate but closely linked project containing a number of useful utility functions and classes for use with [http://www.djangoproject.com/ Django]. We make it a goal to put generic code written for Review Board into Djblets for other developers to use.

Djblets is under the MIT license.


== Installation ==

Installing Djblets is easy. If you have Python setuptools installed, simply type:

Djblets is hosted in a different Subversion repository. You can [http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/djblets browse] the repository or check it out:

While Djblets is documented, there is not yet an online version of this documentation.
