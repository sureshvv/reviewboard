   context diff
       A type of :term:`diff file` that represents changes to a file
       using before/after sections. These are not well supported by
       Review Board.

       Context diffs indicate a changed region of a file by showing
       before and after versions of a group of lines. The changed lines
       in that before and after region are indicated by beginning the
       lines with an exclamation point (``!``). Changes that only add
       lines only show one section.

   diff file
       A file representing changes to one or more files. Common diff
       formats are :term:`unified diff`\s and :term:`context diff`\s.

   interdiffs
       An interdiff is a diff between diffs. They show what has changed
       between two versions of a diff, which is useful when making incremental
       changes to a very large diff.

   post-commit hook
       A script that is executed after a commit is made to a repository.
       See :ref:`Automating post-review` for ways to use post-commit hooks
       to automate submitting review requests to Review Board.

   post-commit review
       A form of code review where code is reviewed after it is submitted
       to a repository, usually in a development branch.

   pre-commit review
       A form of code review where code is reviewed before it even goes
       into a repository. This is generally a more strict way to handle
       code review, which can lead to fewer problems in the codebase.

   unified diff
       A type of :term:`diff file` designed to be easy to parse and easy
       to read by humans. This is the format supported by Review Board.

       Unified diffs indicate the changed region of a file by showing some
       unchanged lines of context, then lines beginning with a minus sign
       (``-``) to show removed lines or a plus sign (``+``) to show added
       lines. Replaced lines are shown by a remove line followed by an add
       line.
